##  Database Collections

- **NasaWildfires**: Wildfire data with dual storage (original + clustered)
- **openWeatherAQIData**: Air quality readings from grid sampling
- **Reports**: Community wildfire reports
- **Users**: User profiles and authentication data
- **Moderators**: Moderator accounts and permissions
- **Notifications**: Real-time user notifications

##  Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Grid Generation**: Dynamic point density based on wildfire risk zones
2. **API Integration**: Batch processing with rate limiting
3. **Data Storage**: Dual storage for performance and data integrity
4. **Clustering Algorithm**: Haversine distance-based point grouping
5. **Real-time Updates**: 4-hour refresh cycle with manual override

### Clustering System
- **Algorithm**: Geographic clustering using Haversine distance
- **Performance**: ~97% payload reduction (18.9MB → 598KB)
- **Flexibility**: Configurable distance thresholds
- **Data Integrity**: Original data always preserved

##  Air Quality Data Sources

### OpenWeather (Primary)
OpenWeather provides reliable air quality data, but requires point-specific requests. Our solution:

- **Grid Sampling**: Intelligent geographic grid with variable density
- **Risk-Based Density**: More points in high wildfire risk areas (CA forests, Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies)
- **EPA AQI Conversion**: PM2.5 concentrations converted to standard 0-500 AQI scale
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized API calls with rate limiting
- **MongoDB Storage**: GeoJSON format for efficient spatial queries

### OpenAQ (Secondary)
OpenAQ provides supplementary data but has limitations:
- Inconsistent geographic coverage in North America
- Variable point locations that change daily
- Requires complex data transformation for civilian-readable metrics

The hybrid approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining data quality.

##  Testing Framework

Comprehensive testing suite with multiple categories:

- **Unit Tests**: Core backend functionality (`tests/tests.py`)
- **Clustering Tests**: Algorithm validation (`tests/clustering/test_clustering.py`)  
- **Integration Tests**: Data flow validation (`tests/integration/test_dual_storage.py`)
- **API Tests**: Live endpoint testing (`tests/api/test_api_endpoints.py`)

## Air Quality Data

Air quality data was originally sourced from OpenAQ, a free online API sourcing air quality data. OpenAQ provided enough data for its purpose: it demonstrated that air quality data is contextually critical and useful to measure when considering wildfires, but not enough data for it to be a viable solution. I realized this early on, but could no seek out a more consistent reliable source in such a short time crunch. I knew that there would have to be a significant effort taken to integrate air quality data in. This was refactored and enhanced in early 2026 to source data from open weather instead.

# Open AQ

OpenAQ provides free data, but this data doesn't cover North America, rather it only polls specific random points around the United States. The random points are inconsistent and can move around every single day. It also requries us to do several costly computations to convert data into a interpretable air quality metric, consistent with civilian-facing weather data. 

# OpenWeather

OpenWeather provides a generous endpoint for air quality, but it is only pollable for specific points. I decided to create a helper function to generate a grid of points. Point density changes depending on the geographical region of the United States. More points are polled in areas with a higher risk of wildfires, such as the forests of California, the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, etc. We process batches of these points to fetch data from the Open Weather API, and then finally store the results into MongoDB.
